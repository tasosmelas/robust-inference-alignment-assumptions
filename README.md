# Robust Inference under Alignment Assumptions

This repository explores how different alignment and preprocessing assumptions can influence downstream biological inference.

## Project motivation
In computational biology, analytical conclusions may depend strongly on preprocessing choices.  
This project investigates the robustness of results under alternative alignment and methodological assumptions.

## Contents
The repository includes exploratory notebooks applied to different biological cases, including:
- HIV-1 Tat
- NS1 protein

The emphasis is on sensitivity analysis and methodological robustness rather than biological discovery.

## Approach
- Comparison of results under alternative preprocessing strategies
- Assessment of sensitivity to analytical choices
- Exploratory and descriptive analysis

## Tools
- Python
- Sequence analysis and data handling libraries
- Visualization and exploratory statistics

## Status
Portfolio project focused on methodological robustness and analytical reasoning.
